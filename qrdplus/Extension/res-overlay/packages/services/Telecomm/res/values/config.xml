    <!-- Determines if the current device should allow emergency numbers
         to be logged in the Call Log.
         (Some carriers require that emergency calls *not* be logged,
         presumably to avoid the risk of accidental redialing from the
         call log UI.  This is a good idea, so the default here is false.)

         TODO: on the other hand, it might still be useful to have some
         record of the emergency calls you've made, or to be able to look
         up the exact date/time of an emergency call.  So perhaps we
         *should* log those calls, but instead fix the call log to disable
         the "call" button for emergency numbers. -->
